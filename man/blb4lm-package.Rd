\title{blb4lm: Implement bag of little bootstrap on Linear regression}
\description{
Implement bag of little bootstrap on linear regression model. 
    It returns coefficients, sigma, and prediction given new data along with their confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The package contains function: blb4lm(), coef.blb4lm(), sigma.blb4lm(), predict.blb4lm().
These functions can help users quickly apply bag of little bootstrap on linear regression
to get the estimates of coefficients and their standard deviation. Also, users and predict
new data with the new model.
